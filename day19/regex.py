# Creating regex objects
# pattern = r'\d\d\d-\d\d\d-\d\d\d\d'
# phoneNumRegex = re.compile(pattern)

# Matching Regex objects
# mo = phoneNumRegex.search("THis is phone number 845-345-4534")
# print("Phne Number Found: "+mo.group())

# More pattern matching with regular ecpressions
# Grouping with parenthisis
# pattern = r'(\d\d\d)-(\d\d\d-\d\d\d\d)'
# phoneNumRegex = re.compile(pattern)
# mo = phoneNumRegex.search("THis is phone number 845-345-4534")
# print("Phone Number Found: "+mo.group())
# print("Area Code: "+mo.group(1))
# print("Remaining Num: "+mo.group(2))


# mo.groups() -> returns a tuple of groups
# print(mo.groups())


# Matching Multiple groups with Pipe
# | -> character is called a Pipe (eg r'Mohit|Rajan' will match Mohit or Rajan based on first occurance)

# nameRegex = re.compile(r'Mohit|Rajan')
# mo = nameRegex.search("Mohit and Rajan are good friends.")
# print(mo.group())

# mo = nameRegex.search("Rajan and Mohit  are good friends.")
# print(mo.group())

# eg
# heroRegex = re.compile(r'Bat(man|mobile|copter|bat)')
# mo = heroRegex.search(" I am a Batcopter")
# print(mo.group())


# Optional matching with ? -> match one or zero
# phoneRegex = re.compile(r'(\d\d\d-)?\d\d\d-\d\d\d\d')
# mo = phoneRegex.search("This is my phone 978-452-4564")
# print(mo.group())
# mo = phoneRegex.search("This is my phone 452-4564")
# print(mo.group())

# Matching Zero or More with the star (* -> match zero or more)
# heroRegex = re.compile(r'Bat(wo)*man')
# mo = heroRegex.search("I am a Batman")
# print(mo.group())
# mo = heroRegex.search("I am a Batwoman")
# print(mo.group())
# mo = heroRegex.search("I am a Batwowowowoman")
# print(mo.group())


# Matching One or More with the Plus
# heroRegex = re.compile(r'Bat(wo)+man')
# mo = heroRegex.search("I am a Batman") # will return None
# mo = heroRegex.search("I am a Batwoman")
# print(mo.group())
# mo = heroRegex.search("I am a Batwowowowoman")
# print(mo.group())
